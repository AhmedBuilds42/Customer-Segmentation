### 🔍 Customer Segmentation with PCA & Clustering Algorithms 🧠

Excited to share my recent project where I performed **customer segmentation** using **unsupervised machine learning** techniques!

📌 **Project Focus**:
I worked on a dataset of **mall customers**, applying **PCA for dimensionality reduction** and comparing clustering methods like **K-Means** and **Agglomerative Clustering** to segment customers based on:

* Gender
* Age
* Annual Income
* Spending Score

### 💡 Key Steps:

✔️ **Feature Scaling**
✔️ **PCA** to reduce dimensionality while retaining key variance
✔️ **KMeans Clustering** with silhouette analysis to find optimal clusters
✔️ **Agglomerative Clustering** + dendrogram for hierarchical insight
✔️ Clean **visualizations** to explore customer groups

---

### 🧠 Insights Gained:

* PCA revealed that the top 2 components captured \~59% of the variance — good enough for visualization.
* Silhouette scores helped tune the ideal number of clusters (4 for KMeans).
* KMeans vs. Agglomerative gave **different clustering behavior**, showing the value of trying multiple algorithms.
* Segmenting customers helps businesses **target better** and understand behavioral patterns!
